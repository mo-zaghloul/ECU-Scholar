## 🔍 Problems & Solutions
Each section describes a problem I faced as a student and how I addressed it in ECU Scholar.

### 📅 Problem: Complicated University Schedule
**Issue:**  
- The university provides a **general schedule** for all groups in my faculty.  
- Students must **manually find their group** and subjects each semester, which is **time-consuming and confusing**.  
- Mistakes in reading the schedule lead to **missing lectures or incorrect timings**.  

**My Solution:**  
✅ **Fetch student schedules directly from the university website.**  
✅ **Display only the student's relevant schedule**, eliminating the need to search manually.  
✅ **Clean and readable UI**, making it easy to check daily and weekly schedules.

### 📚 Problem: Learning Content Spread in Multiple Places
**Issue:**  
- Lecture notes, tutorials, and lab materials are scattered across different platforms.  
- Professors often send files in **WhatsApp group chats**, making them hard to find later.  
- The university website has learning materials but **isn't mobile-friendly**.  

**My Solution:**  
✅ **Centralized Content Tab** in the app for all learning materials.  
✅ **Categorized by Lectures, Tutorials, and Labs**, so students can quickly access what they need.  
✅ **Mobile-friendly display**, unlike the university’s website.

### 📝 Problem: No Proper Task Management for Students
**Issue:**  
- Students struggle to keep track of assignments, deadlines, and tasks.  
- Many rely on **notes apps or WhatsApp messages**, which **lack structure and reminders**.  

**My Solution:**  
✅ **To-Do Tab** where students can **add tasks and set due dates**.  
✅ **Organized interface** for managing academic responsibilities.  
✅ **Potential future enhancement:** **Reminders/notifications** for upcoming deadlines.

### 📊 Problem: No Mobile Access to Student Grades & Profile Info
**Issue:**  
- Students can only check grades via the university website, which **isn't mobile-friendly**.  
- No easy way to view **personal academic details** (e.g., ID, faculty, major).  

**My Solution:**  
✅ **Profile Tab** displaying:  
  - **Student name, ID, faculty, major, and degree**  
  - **Semester grades** in an easy-to-read format  
✅ **Potential future enhancement:** **GPA calculation & progress tracking**.

## 🛠 Future Enhancements
💡 **Push notifications for schedule updates & deadlines**  
💡 **Dark mode for better readability**  
💡 **AI-powered chatbot for FAQs**  

### 🚀 NFC-Based Attendance System  
**Problem:**  
- Currently, **TAs call out student names manually** and mark attendance, which is **time-consuming and exhausting**.  

**Planned Solution:**  
✅ Each TA will have an **NFC tag**.  
✅ Students with the app installed **scan the NFC tag** to mark attendance.  
✅ The app **automatically records the student’s name & ID** in an Excel sheet.  
✅ The attendance record is **easily accessible by the TA**, making the process **faster and more efficient**.

### 📥 TA Content Uploading from Mobile
**Problem:**  
- TAs have expressed that it would be **much easier for them to upload content from their mobile phones** rather than a desktop.  

**Planned Solution:**  
✅ Implementing a **TA-accessible section** in the app where they can **upload lecture slides, notes, and assignments directly from their mobile devices**.

## 🚀 Making Student & TA Life Easier!
With ECU Scholar, I'm working to create a **seamless university experience** for students and teaching assistants alike. The goal is to **simplify academic life** by **centralizing schedules, learning materials, tasks, and attendance** in a **mobile-first** experience.
